# StreamsFinder
Стрыгин Александр (Strygin Aleksandr), 196 (former 194 (big sad))

A Flask-based web app that finds streams with smaller communities and provides a random copypasta and a dad joke to start a friendly conversation in chat.

To run it you need to get a Client ID and a Client Secret from Twitch.tv. You can get them by registering your own application at [Twitch developer console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps). 

To run locally, place `twitch_client_id.txt` and `twitch_client_secret.txt` files with `main.py` and use:
```
python main.py
```

`requirements.txt` is poorly made, unfortunately.
